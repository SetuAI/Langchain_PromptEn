Beneath the sun or floodlight's gleam,

Cricket lives like a waking dream.

A field of green, a willowed sound,

Where legends rise and tales are found.

From dusty lanes where barefoot boys,

Chase every run with shrieks of joy,

To packed arenas roaring loud,

The game unites a global crowd.

A coin is tossed, the captains stare,

As tension thickens in the air.

Bat or bowl? A choice so bold,

A story new begins, retold.

The openers walk, calm yet brave,

Each stride a wave upon the wave.

They face the ball with narrowed eyes,

As silence grips the watching skies.

The bowler runs, a rhythmic beat,

Like thunder galloping on feet.

A leather flash, a wooden crack—

The ball takes flight, then tumbles back.

A flick through square, a drive through mid,

A lofted shot the fielder missed.

A single, double, sprint for three,

The crowd erupts in ecstasy.

But not for long—the trap is set,

The spinner loops, the pitch is wet.

A sudden turn, the bat’s deceived,

And timber flies like falling leaves.

A hush, then cheers, then high-fives loud,

The bowler roars, his head unbowed.

The batter walks with heavy tread,

A tale of glory left unsaid.

The umpire stands with stoic grace,

A calm amidst the frantic pace.

One finger raised, a moment still,

A gesture sharp, a silent thrill.

The scoreboard ticks like beating hearts,

As partnerships rise, and fall apart.

It’s what we cheer, and feel, and know.

A bowler's spell, a batter's stance,

Each moment gives our hearts a chance.

And though formats may rise or fall—

T20 quick, or Tests that sprawl—

The heart remains the same inside,

A game of honor, grit, and pride.

For every match, a tale unfurled,

Of battlefields in cricket’s world.

The whites, the blues, the fiery red,

The crests of dreams, where hope is fed.

From Eden Gardens' mighty cheers,

To MCG through all the years,

From gully rules to county games,

Cricket sings in varied names.

A thousand chants, a billion eyes,

Each moment under azure skies.

It's not just sport, it’s blood and lore,

Of heartbreak, thrill, and something more.

A father watching with his son,

A daughter dreaming of a run.

A granny cheering loud and proud,

A youth who stands out from the crowd.

For every nation, every creed,

This game ignites a common need.

To cheer, to strive, to rise once more,

To chase the line, defend the score.

A drop of sweat, a breath held tight,

A day of sun, a game of light.

The team, the pride, the nation's hope,

The ball, the bat, the stumps, the slope.

A world where sportsmanship is king,

Where pride and passion always cling.

A match may end, the crowd may leave,

But memories stay and never grieve.

The smell of grass, the shout of "Howzat!"

The slip’s sharp catch, the keeper’s chat.

The final cheer, the anthem sung,

The dreams of old, the dreams of young.

And so we play, we watch, we cheer,

For every loss, and win so dear.

The spirit strong, the game alive,

Where heart and soul forever thrive.

For cricket is not just a sport—

It’s where our fondest dreams cavort.

A tale of glory, guts, and grace,

A timeless game no time can chase.

From past to now, from now to then,

It turns us boys and girls to men.

With willow, ball, and silent prayer,

We write our stories in the air.

And as the final ball is bowled,

And tales of glory, once more, told,

The love remains, forever set,

For cricket's magic—never forget.

So here’s to games yet still to play,

To dawn-lit fields and end-of-day.

To every roar, and silent beat—

To cricket’s heart, so pure, so sweet.

A gift, a flame, a timeless thread,

That lives as long as it is said:

“Let’s play a match, just you and me…”

And cricket lives, eternally.
